## important： this project will merge into [rRISC8](http://code.google.com/p/rrisc8) project ##

rRISC8 （reduced RISC 8-bit microcontroller）is a synthesis core written in Verilog language for FPGA. It can execute code generated by AVR-GCC, so you can consider it as a compatible version of AVR micro controller. At least in assembly instruction level, it acts the same as AVR core, both in machine code and time sequence.

This project is inspired by Reduced AVR core implemented in Altera's EPM240 CPLD. You can get the core in OpenCores.org, then I did some modification to make it suitable for Xilinx or Altera's FPGA.

rAVR core version 1.0 was released.
It acted the same way as Russian one does on Opencores(opencores.org/project,avr8).
The design use block ram to store up to 2KByte(1K 16-bit words) program.
What's more, a hex2coe tool is provided for converting AVR Studio generated hex file to Xilinx Core generate required ROM initialized file.
Enjoy! :)

Future development work will be migrated to Altera's Quartus II platforms for lack of the  Xilinx' Spartan-3E demo board.
